      <h1>Who I am</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Wannes. I was born and raised in Belgium. 
        <br>By day, I'm an engineer, working with 3D models of large buildings. 
        <br>br>Interesting? Maybe. 
        <br><br>One thing is certain: it lacks creativity. 
        <br>Thankfully, I find the creativity I need in photography. 
        <br><br>I take pictures—capturing things and themes that interest me. Buildings, landscapes, nightlife—each photo unique, each one carefully taken.

      <h1>My Journey</h1>
      <p>
        My photography journey started in 2011. For my birthday, I received a camera from my stepmother—a Lumix bridge camera. 
        <br><br>Nothing special, but perfect for my first steps. I started taking pictures during the holidays. 
        <br><br>We traveled to France, Norway, Poland, and Croatia. Later on, I began traveling by myself. Thousands and thousands of pictures, taken by me, each telling a story.
        <br>br>But I wasn’t happy with the quality of my pictures. So, I started taking photography courses at KISP. 
        <br><br>I learned all the tips and tricks from the wonderful teachers. Now,it’s time to show the world what I’ve developed over these years
